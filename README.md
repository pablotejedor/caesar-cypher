# Caesar's Cypher

## How does this work?
This kind of cypher works by adding the cypher key to the character's index, based on it's position on the alphabet,
in the way that if key = 1, a = b and so on.
Grammar doesn't change, you only get every character moved to another index.
It's one of my very first react projects. Hope you like it.


## How to use:
Just write the message you want to encrypt in the left textfield and you will get the encrypted message in the right textfield. Use + and - buttons to set the cypher key and "Swap" button to change between encrypt and decrypt.
